# Computer Vision
Here I will add numerous Computer Vision Projects I have coded with neural networks. These projects include:

1. MNIST Digit Image Classifier - Model to classify handwritten digits with the MNIST Digit Dataset, written in MNISTDigit.py
2. Dog and Cat Image Classifier
3. Reverse Image Search(Nearest Image)
4. MNIST Digit Image Generator
