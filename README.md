# Computer Vision
Here I will add numerous Computer Vision Projects I have coded with neural networks. These projects include:

1. MNIST Digit Image Classifier - Model to classify handwritten digits with the MNIST Digit Dataset, written and with more info in MNISTDigit.py
2. Dog and Cat Image Classifier - Model to classify images as either dogs or cats, written and with more info in CatDogClassification.py
3. Reverse Image Search(Nearest Image) - Model that can be given any input image, and classify the nearest image of 8,000 unique images, written and with more info in ImageSearchReverse.py. Results of model are in ImageSearchReverse.png 
4. MNIST Digit Image Generator - Model/DCGAN that uses the MNIST Digit Dataset to write new unique digits, written and with more info in MNISTDCGAN.py. Results of DCGAN are in MNISTDCGAN_img.png
5. Masks Detector - Model that inputs a face image and outputs whether the person is not wearing a mask(0), wearing a mask incorrectly(1), or wearing a mask correctly(2). The results of the model are in the .ipynb file
